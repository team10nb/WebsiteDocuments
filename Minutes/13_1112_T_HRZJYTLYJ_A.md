## Comments

For today's meeting, I prepared a draft script because I am really nervous about this formal meeting. Hence this  led to an awkward situation, I paid too much attention on finishing what I planned to say, and did a poor job in responding supervisor and asking for more feedback. I didn't help the group to get useful information from supervisor, I should focus on interaction more next time and keep thinking during the meeting.
