## Agenda

*全会预计30分钟, 需准备Agenda和requirements纸质版, survey, ethic form电子版*

1. 开场白（预计1分钟）

	This is the agenda of today's meeting. **(Show her the Agenda)**
	
	Today's meeting is gonna be devided into 3 parts, which may take about 30 minutes
	
	- quick review of taks done last week
	- discussion on several topics
	- Q&A time
	
2. quick review（预计2分钟）

  - Yani has been working on the group site with Yiming and they are also going to design a group logo for us

    a preview version of it has been developed and detailed content will be added in few days

  - Yiming has sent you a email with a minute file attatched, and we have received several files from you

  - we've discussed about the target group. 

  - We've been working on analysing more similar products and writing requirements of our product and also come up with several new ideas. They'll be declared later in the meeting

  - we've designed a survey in order to gather and verify requirements. This will be discussed later.

  - We've decided to use Agile method in order to include more client participation. However, since we are new in SE, somehow detailed plan will also be made to help manage the whole process.

  - we've done personality test and got more familiar with each other

    does anyone has any questions in this part?

3. discussion (预计20分钟)

   1. About agenda （预计3分钟）

     - The one I gave you is written based on the template you proveded. but we've got a more detailed formal english one like the one Yingming sent you. Do you think the simple one is quite enough or cuold you give us any suggestions on the one we provided. **(Show her the one we provided)**
     - We've looked through the report of 1617 group. We found they attatched their minutes in the report. Shall we do the same thing?
     - I remember dave said something about using LaTex. Is it possible or necessary to use Latex for the report or even the agenda and minutes?

   2. About target group （预计5分钟）

   - based on our experience, it would be a great help if we could play with an animated sorting algorithm app when we first time get in touch with them especially in our first year of university

   - so we come up with an idea that the target group could mainly be university students majored in computer science or any other course may need knowledge of sorting algorithms and students who are interested in this.
   - Under this circumstance, it would be easier to do user research. We can simply gather requirements right in our uni since we have sesa staff yani. She said sesa could help with that.

   3. About survey **(Show her the survey)** （预计2分钟）

   - Based on different background knowledge people have, the survey would automatically display related questions to the specific group of people
   - Any suggestions on the survey we made

   4. About requirements **(show her the requirements)** （预计6分钟）

   - This is a very early stage verision only for preview
   - We focuses more on innovations which are brand new features among similar products
   - As for correctness, we are still not clear about it. Do your mean we need to tell user that this sorting algorithm can do the sorting task correctly? Can you give us a more specific example on this.

   5. About platform & language （预计2分钟）

   - Single platform or multi-platform?
   - which platform you prefer us to do on or based on the survey/research?

   6. About ethic forms **(Show her the ethic form)** (预计2分钟)

   - shall we write all of our names here and submit it as a team?
   - when can we deploy the survey? until the ethic forms are all completed?

   Any questions for this part?

   

4. Q&A（预计6分钟）
  - 提问，大家是否还有其他问题
  - 下次会议chairperson和secretary，会议时间，订房间
  - 确认要完成的事项，大家下阶段的任务

（这部分归 Sec 写）

### Outcomes

（根据上面的Agenda来分点写，是否完成，结果如何。不要每句话都记，要记会议进程里讨论出的最终内容，summary of all discussed main points, all decisions, all action points）



1. discussion (预计20分钟)

   1. About agenda （预计3分钟）

      - 他喜欢他自己给的那个版本。那我们要做的事就是每次chair要给一版他的agenda给他。


   3. About survey **(Show her the survey)** （预计2分钟）

   - Based on different background knowledge people have, the survey would automatically display related questions to the specific group of people

     - Learning tools?
     - 问卷的draft版很不错

     - 把英文放在中文前面
     - Correctness: ?
       - difficult point??但是没有解决这个问题

   4. About requirements **(show her the requirements)** （预计6分钟）

   - As for correctness, we are still not clear about it. Do your mean we need to tell user that this sorting algorithm can do the sorting task correctly? Can you give us a more specific example on this.
     - 太详细了。这已经不是requirement了，在设计了。应该是先要求，再设计程序。现在看起来，你在通过程序写要求。看起来很奇怪。太正式了。不要refer to click，button，尽量描述什么功能他要实现。比如第五个，
       - 我大概懂了什么意思了。我感觉听他的话来说，我们要舍弃掉这两个图，他们有点限制我们的想法。
       - 必须的要求和可选的要求（如果有更好，没有也没事）。
       - 他觉得我们的想法还可以。
       - 把最重要的需求拿出来，不是说把流程展示出来。

2. 下次会议准备 (实际完成时间: x分钟)
  - **Chairperson:** 
  - **Secretary:**
