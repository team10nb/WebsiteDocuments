### Outcomes



1. Opening (Time spent: 2 minutes)

	- Completed
	
2. Self-introduction (Time spent: 3 minutes)

	- Completed
	
3. Discussion (Time spent: 50 minutes)

  0. General

  - English speaking in formal meetings (compulsory)
  - Heshan will join our informal repo

  1. The solution of proving the sorting algorithm’ s correctness.

     - Guide user to understand the sorting algorithm

     - Allow user to create an algorithm in their way. 

     - Additional question: confirm that the game can help prove the correctness

  2. About Requirement

     - Basically, first we come up with our own ideas then check existing implementation. Analyse existing ones' pros and cons. After this, build a prototype and do market research on what our user will like.
     - Functional requirement should **think about what we can operate in the software as a user**, it more focuses on the function the user needs to achieve; non-functional requirement more focuses on the constraints on what the user needs to do such as the language preference,  opening source for user to download
     - **Functions we build must be able to improve the ability to help users**. Don't come up with new idea that's only for differentiating our product with others. Main task for requirement is to let user to understand the algorithm. Designing different shape on disorder elements for making some differences from other software might not exactly achieve the goal. Considering change the integers to letters.
     - Deciding the stakeholder. Focusing children group might be a little difficult, because we do not have enough experience for contacting with kids. Additionally, if we need to interview groups in a formal way, we should prepare for the ethic form.
     - Functional requirements should be more specific and precise but not vague

  3. Other issues

     - Ethic forms are on the air
     - 1617 project 

  4. Software engineering method

     - Depend on team members
     - Heshan prefers Agile

  5. Experience from earlier team

     - **Cooperation** and **teamwork**
     - **Innovation** is very important

4. Preparation for next meeting (Time spent: x minutes)
	- **Chairperson:** Ruizi Han
	
	- **Secretary:** Yiming Tang
	
	- **Time:** 10/20 Tuesday Night (specific time will be confirmed on 10/18) 
	
	  What is going to be discussed in the next meeting:
	
	- Discuss the market analysis
	
	- Confirm the target market

## Comments


I didn't control the time well, because I didn't expect that a question could develop into a discussion of nearly ten minutes. I had planned to ask a few questions in about ten minutes, but I didn't expect that the 30 minute meeting would last nearly an hour.

Next time, we can omit some questions in a planned way, and then the chairperson may have to rehearse in advance. If necessary, he can interrupt the discussion and say "we are running out of time, get into the next part.
"

In addition, the chairperson can ask the team members in the wechat group whether we can go on to the next topic.
Every time the chairperson enter the next part, he or she must ask everyone about "any questions from others".
