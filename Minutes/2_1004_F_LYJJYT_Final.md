## Comments

Whole meeting process has finished successfully. Agenda are basically completed.

Main problems found here are:

 

1. Deadline for tasks should be more reasonable, it is better to make sure that there is enough time to submit the bids

 

2. To make more efficiency, if the leader needs to collect the information from partners, asking by order forwardly instead of waiting, but if someone wants to speak at first, the priority should be given.
