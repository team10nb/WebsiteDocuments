#### Outcomes

1. Literature review part

   - Yijie has provided the structure of literature review


   - After analyzing some of the existing products, we found them very similar. We could take the advantage from them, even they are quite common design
   - However, we can optimize the animation, data visualization and algorithm visualization
   - We can also optimize by improving the ability of interaction
   - Question: Do we need to add papers
   - Answer: We could. By proving our software is useful in expanding description

2. Arrangement of focus group

   - three groups will be there for discussions.
   - Y1 with little knowledge
   - Y2 with knowledge but does not understand correctness
   - Y3 with abundant knowledge with correctness

3. Timeline

   - review the timeline
   - make sure everything goes fine under the timeline
   - gantt chart will be later made according to the timeline

4. Requirements

   - gather requirements: functional and non-functional and user story
   - specification: UML(use case, class, sequence), with rapid prototype

5. Morning meeting
   - yiming will maintain the public repo
   - discussed interview questions, questionnaire and focus group
   - email heshan with relevant files
