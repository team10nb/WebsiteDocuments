## Agenda

*expected 30m*

1. opening (expected 1m)

	This is the agenda of today's meeting. **(Show Dr. Heshan the Agenda)**
	
	Today's meeting is gonna be devided into 3 parts, which may take about 30 minutes
	
	- quick review of taks done last week
	- discussion on several topics
	- Q&A time
	
2. quick review (expected 2m)

  - Yani has been working on the group site with Yiming and they are also going to design a group logo for us

    a preview version of it has been developed and detailed content will be added in few days

  - Yiming has sent you a email with a minute file attatched, and we have received several files from you

  - we've discussed about the target group. 

  - We've been working on analysing more similar products and writing requirements of our product and also come up with several new ideas. They'll be declared later in the meeting

  - we've designed a survey in order to gather and verify requirements. This will be discussed later.

  - We've decided to use Agile method in order to include more client participation. However, since we are new in SE, somehow detailed plan will also be made to help manage the whole process.

  - we've done personality test and got more familiar with each other

    does anyone has any questions in this part?

3. discussion (Expected 20m)

   1. About agenda （Expected 3m）

     - The one I gave you is written based on the template you proveded. but we've got a more detailed formal english one like the one Yingming sent you. Do you think the simple one is quite enough or cuold you give us any suggestions on the one we provided. **(Show her the one we provided)**
     - We've looked through the report of 1617 group. We found they attatched their minutes in the report. Shall we do the same thing?
     - I remember dave said something about using LaTex. Is it possible or necessary to use Latex for the report or even the agenda and minutes?

   2. About target group (expected 5m)

   - based on our experience, it would be a great help if we could play with an animated sorting algorithm app when we first time get in touch with them especially in our first year of university

   - so we come up with an idea that the target group could mainly be university students majored in computer science or any other course may need knowledge of sorting algorithms and students who are interested in this.
   - Under this circumstance, it would be easier to do user research. We can simply gather requirements right in our uni since we have sesa staff yani. She said sesa could help with that.

   3. About survey **(Show her the survey)** (expected 2m)

   - Based on different background knowledge people have, the survey would automatically display related questions to the specific group of people
   - Any suggestions on the survey we made

   4. About requirements **(show her the requirements)**  (expected 6m)

   - This is a very early stage verision only for preview
   - We focuses more on innovations which are brand new features among similar products
   - As for correctness, we are still not clear about it. Do your mean we need to tell user that this sorting algorithm can do the sorting task correctly? Can you give us a more specific example on this.

   5. About platform & language (expected 2m)

   - Single platform or multi-platform?
   - which platform you prefer us to do on or based on the survey/research?

   6. About ethic forms **(Show Dr. Heshan the ethic form)** (expected 2m)

   - shall we write all of our names here and submit it as a team?
   - when can we deploy the survey? until the ethic forms are all completed?

   Any questions for this part?

   

4. Q&A (expected 6m)

### Outcomes

（summary of all discussed main points, all decisions, all action points）



1. Discussion

   1. Dr. Heshan would like agendas be in her template's style. So what every chairperson has to do is edit the agenda in the style and send it to Dr. Heshan before the meeting.
2. Review
   1. Dr. Heshan is overall satisfied with our process.


      3. About survey

               1. Dr. Heshan likes our draft questionnaire. Her advice is put English in front of Chinese, because the official language is EN.
               2. Dr. Heshan mentioned correctness is a difficult point, but in this meeting we are still not clear about correctness.

      4. About requirements
               1. Dr. Heshan thinks we are not dealing with requirements, but designing the software. This is too far from current schedule. She says we seem to be already having the software model, writing requirements based on this. This is not in line with the software engineering process. 
               2. She gave us these suggestions: don't write "click", "button" in the requirements, it is better to describe which functions it would implement; also, distinguish functional requirements and non-functional requirements; finally, write out the most important requirements, instead of show the process.

5. Next meeting (informal)

   **Chairperson:** Yani

   **Secretary:** Yuting

   **Time:** 27 Oct 2020

## Comments

Due to the time limit, ethics and correctness were not discussed clearly.
I have problem on preparations on the requirements.
To save paper, don't bring hard copy, email Dr. Heshan instead.
Chairperson and secratary shall sit around Heshan. This would help.
Chairperson shall control the time adequately. If the situation is losing control, secratary shall help speed up.
For speeding up the whole process, it's ok to read agenda. Still, try hard to perform naturally.
