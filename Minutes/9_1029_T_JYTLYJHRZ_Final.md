## Minute



### Outcomes



1. Review what we have finished (Time spent: 30 minutes).
   - The minutes
		- For the appendix of report, both minute templates are ok, it depends on us. We decide to use our template.
		- The minutes do not need to be sent to supervisor every week, until there is something needs to be confirmed.
     
   - Website checking
     - Grammar and vocabulary problem of introduction: 1) the first long sentence need to be split into bullet points. 2) change the sentence "project is promising", it is not suitable to say a project is "promising". 3) change the sentence "the software is the entry level".
     - Content problem of introduction: 1) the key point should be the property of the software (like open source) and the aim of the software (like help users to understand and prove the correctness of sorting algorithm). 2) more types of the sorting algorithm should be mentioned: bubble, quick, merge…
     - Diagram design: 1) Gantt chart: add the dependency between the tasks. 2) Prototype: a little similar to previous work, it needs to be modified and be more innovative to impress users.
     - Team role: 1) We need to add a software developer. 2) The appropriate method is that the team can be divided into small group and take responsibility to each function of the software or a specific sorting algorithm and put them together in the end. 
   
2. Check the materials for interview and survey (Time spent: 20 minutes).
   - Participant consent form and information sheet
     - Check each form whether the name of university is correct: "Ningbo China".
     - delete the bracket of "omit ...".
     
   - Questions for the interview
     - If we need to ask question 2, we may need to prepare a prototype for the teacher’s better understanding.
     - Before the interview, we need to do some preparation, such as provide some slides and book a room.

   - Questionnaire

     - Q11: Change "which one do you think is useless" to "which one do you like".
     - Q12: Make sure all the data we collected is useful for the requirement specification later: Q12 needs to be deleted.

3. Decide which idea for correctness proof is better (Time spent: 15 minutes).
   - Use the first proposal: simple one, we need to do it as simple as possible.We'd better not mention abstract concepts in the software since  they are too complex for beginners. We can see how it goes firstly, then think about whether we need to add those more complicated knowledge. 
   - Applying the first proposal, we can focus on the mathematical induction to prove sorting algorithms' correctness.
   - Applying the first proposal, the input does not need to be very complicated, and integer is fine for easy understanding. For illegal input, we can choose characters: A,B,C.
   
4. Discuss the requirements specification and definition (Time spent: 10 minutes).
   - Choose the latest version which we have learned in FSE. Follow the FSE powerpoint and textbook.
   
5. Time control problem (Time spent: 10 minutes).

	- Meeting Time should be controlled in 30 minutes. Yiming Tang will be the one who control the time of meeting, he will interrupt the discussion when the time is not enough. 
	- Yani Huang suggested that we may need to make a brief introduction for what we have done in each week firstly, so time can be leave for more essential topic. 
  
6. Preparation for next meeting (Time spent: 2 minutes)
   - **Chairperson:** Yijie Lu
   - **Secretary:** Shiliang Chen
   - **Time:** 11/3 19:30
   - We may discuss our team role again.

## Comments

1. The meeting time should be tight controlled next time. The chairperson should find out suitable time to interrupt the discussion when time is not enough. 
2. Before formal meeting, the chairperson should send relevant materials to the supervisor as early as possible and  kindly remind supervisor to have a glance in advance.
3. Reduce the content discussed in the formal meeting. Do not discuss less important content in the formal meeting.
