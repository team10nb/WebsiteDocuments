## Agenda

*The whole meeting is expected to take 45 minutes.*

1. Complete the requirement survey . (25 min-30 min)
   - Introduction of the survey.
   - Questions about correctness.
   - Specify the total number of the survey we expect to collect.
   - Decide who is going to have meeting with the "Introduction of Algorithm" lecturer.
2. Check the site together. (5 min)
3. Discuss topic for the next formal meeting. (10 min- 15 min)

## Minute

#### Outcomes

1. Abridge and confirm the questions in the survey (About 20 minutes).
   - Delete Q5 and the UI question. 
   - Change the options of Q4, Q7, Q10, Q11.
2. Think about the requirement (About 30 minutes).
   - Animated display function(control the speed, last step and first step. stop button).
   - The tutorial for beginners.
   - Multi-language.
   - What kind of sorting algorithms will be include?  (six provided, multi-choices for users to choose).
   - Display the history record for users.
   - Cheat sheet (brief notes).
   - Questions about correctness.

3. Discuss the form of the proof the correctness (About 20 minutes).
   - The first version: do not include the abstract concepts(e.g. partial correctness), just prove that for any type of legal input, the algorithm will show the correct output. And for the illegal inputs, the algorithm will show the error or warning.  
   - The second version: detailed introduce the necessary concepts, maybe include the proof rules. Explain concepts through intentional code failures. And user chooses whether to display the proof or not.

4. Check the site together (About 10 minutes).
   - Confirm the personal information.
   - Confirm the documents post on the site.
   - Have a public link for our Github.
5. Decide who will take the interview with the IPA module convenor (About 2 minutes).
